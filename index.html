    Technical Exercise 7:
    <br />
    Exploring JavaScript Libraries
  </h1>

  <h3>Example Exploration</h3>
  <p>
    1. p5.js Continuous Lines. I am using this example because I want to create an additional interaction for users to draw out their thoughts and feelings.
    I hope to emulate a sketchbook on a journal as part of my interaction. For my submission, I created a simple drawing pen and changed the color to make it much more fun and vibrant. Example of reference can be found <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/drawing-continuous-lines.html">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
2. p5.js Random. I am using this example from Happy Coding website since I wanted to add some more colors and shape to my background. Although its not the final design, I hope to create a vision of a garden or outdoor nature. I am hoping to create a background that would include a speech interaction where users can verbalize their thoughts and feelings. Example of reference can be found <a href="https://happycoding.io/tutorials/p5js/random">here</a>.</p>
